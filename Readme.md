This Shiny application calculates an individual's basal metabolic rate (BMR) in
order to estimate the **daily kilocalorie intake** required to maintain weight
by applying the [Harris-Benedict
equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris%E2%80%93Benedict_equation).

Usage of this application isn't complicated, simply input your **personal
information** (like age and weight) at the panel on the left. A
**confirmation** of the input will be displayed on the right, and, below it, the
**daily calorie intake** for maintaining weight.
